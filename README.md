## Physical Model & Simulation Mechanics

### Particle Dynamics
The atomic particles in HeatWave implement a sophisticated Brownian motion model, accurately representing the random thermal motion of molecules in a fluid. This stochastic process provides a realistic visualization of molecular kinetics at various temperature ranges.

### Thermal Transfer Calculations
Heat propagation between particles is computed using a precise distance-mass calibration formula:

The heat transfer mechanism takes into account:
- Interparticle distances
- Particle masses
- Temperature differentials
- Material-specific thermal properties

This physics-based approach ensures that the thermal interactions closely mirror real-world behavior, where:
- Heat transfer rates decrease with distance
- Particle mass influences thermal capacity
- Temperature gradients drive heat flow
- Different materials exhibit unique thermal characteristics

The simulation employs these calculations in real-time to create an accurate representation of thermal dynamics at the molecular level, making it an invaluable tool for understanding heat transfer mechanisms and molecular behavior under various thermal conditions.

You can obtain the heat differences using the following formula:
